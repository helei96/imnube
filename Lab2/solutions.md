Why is it important to choose a License? 
  Licenses are important for users to acquire the rights to use an available product or software. Having a certain license available that approves distribution and use permits consumers of your software access to use it.
Why they shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
  When there is no license explicitly stated on a project or open software, according to copyright law it is considered all rights reserved.
