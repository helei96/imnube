2) Why is it important to choose a License? 
  Licenses are important for users to acquire the rights to use an available product or software. Having a certain license available that approves distribution and use permits consumers of your software access to use it.
3) Why they shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
  When there is no license explicitly stated on a project or open software, according to copyright law it is considered all rights reserved. All rights reserved disallows any form of reproduction, distribution or modification without explicit permission.
4) Why Gopher failed and HTTP survived? Do you agree?
  Yes I do agree, because at the birth of the web and use of hypertext, the difference between gopher and http mainly was the use of indexing and the use of the user interface. Essentially in the beginning, the http used html and had several base functions that the users could utilize, and the hypertext used in the documents permitted links to other hypertext locations. Gopher on the other hand was very subjective and fluid to the user, and at the birth of the web, user preference was a more advanced feature and for people who were just learning how to navigate and utilize this new "internet" feature, structure on the user interface was more important than structure in the system. 
5) Can you justify why such a license was chosen?
  For Sailfish. Why the Sailfish license technically isn't open source is because it doesn't permit access to the source code. This is already a violation of the open source principles. Why this "license" was chosen does make some sense, as open source is mostly chaotic and on a volunteering basis. Having the company under control of the OS and further development controls the environment and prevents any dissonance from occuring.
6) Choose a license.
  Personally I like GPL or just basic copylefting licenses because it permitted distribution, usage and modification of software but must allow software freedom for any modification in the case of distribution.
