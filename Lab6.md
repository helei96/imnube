First we forked the repo and claimed a bug. Bug:made sure to never return the password on a profile.  
We made an attempt to build observatory on our own. It was only partially successful. Halted due to memory restrictions.  
Then we resorted to TravisCI build checking after our own attempt at writing code to test for the bug.  
TravisCI worked, and we pushed and made a pull request in the end.
